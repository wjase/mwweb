## Pixels 
<div class="inset">
Twenty tiny pastel and graphite drawings on wood. Like Flux, the forward facing surfaces of each of the wooden blocks are slightly angled. Pixels was originally conceived as an installation, but because of the delicate nature of the media used, the work was framed and glazed as one work.
