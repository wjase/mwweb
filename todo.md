# items to be done

* Remove contact page

* Change title of About to Statement and Bio

* Change title of Lamella to Gallery

* New works to appear at the top of the Gallery page

* Turn off the Pixels, Ned Series and Flux pages

* Restore the enlargement function of the image thumbnails in the Gallery

* Gallery page to be separated into years, with each year title on the left.

* If possible, I would like to know how I can curate the works within each year group, so that visually similar works are grouped together. 

* Create new page called More Info, for small statements about selected artworks and more images such as details and exhibition and installation shots.

* Place Flux, Pixels and Ned Series in the new Gallery page, (all under 2019) and remove the separate pages for these.

* Change order of pages to Gallery, Statement and Bio, More Info, Exhibitions (and Contact when it’s working)

* Discuss what can be done to better represent “Between Scylla and Charybdis”, in the Gallery page.
